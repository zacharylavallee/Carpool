## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment
1. Set up your production database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run database validation: `python db_scripts/validate_database.py`
4. Deploy using your preferred method (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

### Health Checks
- Database validation: `python db_scripts/validate_database.py`
- Schema sync check: `python db_scripts/db_sync_checker.py`

## Security Features

- **Private Channel Enforcement**: Bot only works in private channels and DMs
- **Owner-Only Permissions**: Users can only modify their own cars and trips
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Destructive actions require explicit confirmation
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign key relationships prevent orphaned data
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Bot not in channel" errors**
   - Ensure the bot is added to the private channel
   - Check bot permissions in Slack app settings

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables
   - Run `python db_scripts/validate_database.py` to check database health

3. **Command not responding**
   - Check Slack app slash command configuration
   - Verify request URL is accessible
   - Check application logs for errors

### Getting Help

1. Use `/help` command in Slack for usage instructions
2. Run database validation scripts for database issues
3. Check application logs for detailed error information
